## Java Software Testing Exercises and Studies

This repository serves as a personal collection of exercises and study materials focused on modern software testing practices in Java.

The exercises cover a range of testing concepts, including unit testing, mocking dependencies, and using various assertion libraries to validate application behavior.
Technologies and Tools:

- Java: The core programming language for all exercises.
- JUnit 5: The primary testing framework for writing and running tests.
- Mockito: The mocking framework used to isolate the code under test by creating mock objects and verifying interactions.
- Assertions: A variety of assertion libraries are used to make test validation more readable and expressive. This includes JUnit's built-in assertions and AssertJ for fluent assertions
